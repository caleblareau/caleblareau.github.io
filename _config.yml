 I am currently a Stanford Science Fellow in the School of Medicine at Stanford University and Parker Scholar at 
 the Parker Institute of Cancer Immunotherapy. My research concerns the development and application of single-cell
 technologies to inform properties of human physiology, including the somatic changes in tissues and the dynamics of 
 immune cells within the tumor microenvironment. I am particularly interested in studying and increasing the efficacy
 and applications of immunotherapies. 
 
 My work at Stanford is supervised by Ansuman Satpathy and Anshul Kundaje.
