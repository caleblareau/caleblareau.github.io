 I am currently a Stanford Science Fellow in the School of Medicine at Stanford University and Parker Scholar at 
 the Parker Institute of Cancer Immunotherapy. My research concerns the development and application of single-cell
 technologies to inform properties of human physiology, including the somatic changes in tissues and the dynamics of 
 immune cells within the complex tissues such as humans.
 
 
 My work at Stanford is supervised by Ansuman Satpathy and Anshul Kundaje in the Departments of Pathology and Genetics.
