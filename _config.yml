 I am currently a [Stanford Science Fellow](https://stanfordsciencefellows.stanford.edu/meet-fellows)
 in the School of Medicine at Stanford University and [Parker Scholar](https://www.parkerici.org/the-latest/funding-the-future-of-cancer-research-the-parker-institute-for-cancer-immunotherapy-awards-nearly-3-million-to-six-early-career-researchers/) 
 at the Parker Institute of Cancer Immunotherapy.
 
 
 My research concerns the development and application of genomics technologies to inform properties of human physiology, including the somatic changes that occur in our cells as we age. 
 In particular, I am interested in studying the earliest events of tumor initiation (pre-malignant clonal expansions) and the 
 immune cells within these tissues and tumors that permit the seeding of the tumor. These highly-collaborative works have recently been highlighted by
 [_Nature_](pdfs/nature-singlecell-multiomics-analysis.pdf), [_Nature Methods_](pdfs/naturemethods-dogma.pdf), and the
 [10x Genomics _Innovator Series_](https://www.10xgenomics.com/blog/introducing-the-innovator-series-hacking-atac-seq-to-perform-clonal-lineage-tracing-in-tumors).
 
 
 My research at Stanford is mentored by [Ansuman Satpathy](https://satpathylab.com/lab/) and
 [Anshul Kundaje](https://sites.google.com/site/anshulkundaje/students)
 in the Departments of Pathology and Genetics at the School of Medicine.

          I currently hold appointments in the Department of Pathology and the Department of Genetics at Stanford University School of Medicine. As part of the 
          inaugrual class of [Stanford Science Fellows](https://stanfordsciencefellows.stanford.edu/meet-fellows), I lead a semi-independent research program to study fundamental attributes of human tissues in health and disease. My research is supported
          by funding from the [Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/funding-the-future-of-cancer-research-the-parker-institute-for-cancer-immunotherapy-awards-nearly-3-million-to-six-early-career-researchers-301238626.html),
          and Stanford Medical School.

          I completed my graduate studies at Harvard Medical School, where I earned my PhD in the Division of Medicine Sciences. [My dissertation](https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/37365912)
          focusd on the development of new single-cell methods and technologies, particular the development of an approach to trace clonal lineages in human cells via
          somatic mtDNA mutations. My time at Harvard was split between the Broad Institute, Boston Children's Hospital, and Dana Farber Cancer Institute.

          For two summers during my undergraduate training, I completed research projects at the [Max Planck Institute for Psychiatry](https://www.psych.mpg.de/en) in Munich Germany, which was 
          supported by a [Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst RISE Fellowship](https://engineering.utulsa.edu/lareau-research/). Here, I examined potential biomarkers in the blood
          that were associated with patient outcomes in response to deep brain stimulation, an investigative new therapy for treatment-resistant depression.

          I completed my undergraduate education at the University of Tulsa where I graduate _summa cum laude_ with a BSc in Biochemistry and Mathematics. Here,
          I performed research in the _in silico_ Research Group, establishing computational methods for the network modeling of human genetic variation data.
